    "\n",
    "In this lab we provide you with the basics for creating your own Fuzzy Logic System (FLS). We will examine the theory and put it to practice at the same time.\n",

    "### Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with an overview of all the components of an FLS:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/blP93rN.png\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>fuzzifier</b> needs:\n",
    "- input variables, output variables\n",
    "- membership functions for its variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>rules</b> include:\n",
    "- an antecedent containing a selected mf per variable (e.g. if x1 is low ...)\n",
    "- operators: and, or, not (in this lab we only consider one operator in a rule's antecedent)\n",
    "- a consequent containing a selected mf for the output variable (Mamdani) or a formula for the output variable (TSK)\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>inference mechanism</b> does:\n",
    "- uses the firing strength of a rule to calculate the result of the implication\n",
    "- (for which it uses an implication operator: min, prod)\n",
    "- aggregates the results\n",
    "\n",
    "The aggregated result is then <b>defuzzified</b> and becomes a crisp value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Will make a start with implementing your own FLS. This can be of great help for your project, for which you will - hopefully - implement your own FLS too, and for your understanding of Fuzzy Logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to create a Mamdani inference system that helps you decide how much money to put aside per month for buying a new laptop / TV / headphone:\n",
    "- input variables: income (0-1000), and the quality of your current device (0-10).\n",
    "- output variable: amount of money (1-500)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is <b>by no means a perfect</b> implementation of an FLS, it is a very simple one and would have to be adapted for being usable for the FL projects."

    "\n",
    "A fuzzy IF-THEN rule is composed of an antecedent and a consequent, like the implications you have seen with propositional and first order logic.\n",
    "- In the antecedent conditions for input variables are connected with an operator (AND, OR, NOT), e.g. \"IF x1 is mf1 AND x2 is mf3\", or \"IF x1 is mf1 OR x2 is mf2\".\n",
    "- The AND operator represents taking the intersection of fuzzy sets, which can be accomplished by choosing a T-Norm operation, such as minimum.\n",
    "- The OR operator represents taking the union of fuzzy sets, which can be accomplished by choosing a T-Conorm operation, such as maximum.\n",
    "- The NOT operator, the complement, is calculated by 1 minus a membership value. For example: NOT x1 is mf1, would be 1 - (membership of x1 to mf1).\n",
    "- By the use of the AND, NOT and OR we combine the different parts of the antecedent into a single number, which is the firing strength of the antecedent.\n",
    "- The consequent represents an action that we undertake if the rule fires.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to add some simple rules for our FLS: complete rules that do not have mixed operators. Here we represent a rule through 3 variables:\n",
    "- <b>Antecedent</b>, represented as a list of names of membership functions. The index of the name corresponds to the variable it belongs to, for example: [\"medium\", \"low\"], where \"medium\" belongs to the first variable in *inputs* and \"low\" corresponds to the second variable in *inputs*.\n",

    "\n",
    "As already mentioned, there is Mamdani type inference and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type inference:\n",
    "- With Mamdani type inference we represent the consequents of fuzzy rules as fuzzy sets (using membership functions). We use a rule's firing strength to adapt the height of the membership function in the consequent, using the implication operator (minimum or product). The consequents are then aggregated into one area (taking the maximum of all consequents for the entire input range), on which we apply a defuzzification method, such as 'largest of max', 'smallest of max' or 'centroid'.\n",
    "- With TSK type inference we represent the consequents as a function of the input variables, or a constant. To combine the consequents into one output number we calculate a weighted average, where the weights are the rules' firing strengths.\n",

    "### Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "We will finalize our system using Mamdani type inference by performing the following three steps:\n",
    "1. Gathering the largest firing strength per membership function of the output variable (implemented in your rulebase in Step 3)\n",
    "2. Discretizing the range of your output variable and applying the aggregation method (<b>max</b>): for every bin you find the maximum fuzzy membership value. Notice that the membership functions of the output variable are `cut off' according to the firing strengths, with the implication method (<b>min</b>).\n",
    "To accomplish this we perform two steps:\n",
    "    - First we find where the aggregated area starts and ends on the x-axis\n",
    "    - Second we discretize the area between start and end into 201 points (thus representing the area in 200 bins)\n",
    "3. Applying two defuzzification methods: implement smallest of max (<b>som</b>) and largest of max (<b>lom</b>)."
